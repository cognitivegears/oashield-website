Convert your existing OpenAPI / Swagger specifications to Web Application Firewall (WAF)
rules automatically! OAShield helps minimize the attack surface available to bad actors.
This can be used in conjunction with traditional WAF sets like the [OWASP Core Rule Set](https://owasp.org/www-project-modsecurity-core-rule-set/).

## OAShield Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="HTTP Method Restriction" icon="information">
		Only allow HTTP method types defined for an individual REST endpoint.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Parameter Validation" icon="add-document">
		Don't allow attackers to send in any parameters they want. Instead restrict
		the available parameters to only those used by each endpoint directly.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Data Type Checking" icon="setting">
		OAShield rules act as positive input validation for REST applications. It works by
		validating patterns defined within the OpenAPI spec, or if not defined, default
		validations based on data type and other value restriction information from the
		specification.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Unknown Endpoint Rejection" icon="warning">
		Any unknown endpoints are rejected by default. Fails closed, not open!
	</Card>
	<Card title="DevSecOps Friendly" icon="rocket">
		Use CI/CD automation flows to automatically generate and publish the most recent
		version of the API to the WAF, ensuring that your protection is always up to date!
	</Card>
	<Card title="Read the docs" icon="open-book">
		Additional background and information at [About OAShield](/about). Or dive in with [the OAShield Docs](/reference/example).
