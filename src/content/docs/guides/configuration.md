title: Configuration
description: Every OAShield option, including engine flavors, deny behavior, logging, and validation limits.
---

OAShield is configured through the OpenAPI Generator `--additional-properties` flag,
passed comma-separated:

```bash
java -cp oashield-cli.jar org.openapitools.codegen.OpenAPIGenerator \
  generate -g modsecurity3 -i api.yaml -o out \
  --additional-properties engineFlavor=coraza,schemaRulePath=rules/schema.json
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `engineFlavor` | `modsecurity3` | Target engine: `modsecurity3` or `coraza` |
| `validateBodySchema` | `true` | Emit request-body validation rules |
| `generateJsonSchema` | `true` | Emit the JSON Schema file |
| `jsonSchemaOutputFile` | `schema.json` | JSON Schema file name |
| `schemaRulePath` | same as `jsonSchemaOutputFile` | Schema path written inside the `@validateSchema` rule. Coraza resolves it relative to the **server process working directory**, not the rules directory |
| `denyAction` | `deny` | What happens when a rule blocks: `deny`, `drop`, `redirect`, or `pass` (detection-only: violations are logged but requests go through) |
| `denyStatus` | `403` | HTTP status returned on deny (100–599). With `denyAction=redirect`, set a 3xx status; non-3xx values make the engine fall back to 302 |
| `denyRedirectUrl` | (none) | Absolute http(s) URL to redirect blocked requests to; required when `denyAction=redirect` |
| `enableLogging` | `true` | Emit `log,auditlog` on generated rules; `false` emits `nolog` instead |
| `includeEngineConfig` | `true` | Emit `SecRuleEngine On`, `SecRequestBodyAccess On`, and the `SecDefaultAction` in `mainconfig.conf`. Set `false` when your existing WAF configuration already defines these |
| `unknownMediaTypePolicy` | `pass` | Handling of declared request media types the WAF cannot inspect (e.g. `application/octet-stream`, `text/plain`): `pass` lets them through after the content-type gate, `block` rejects them |
| `basePath` | auto | Path prefix for all generated path-match rules. Defaults to the path component of the spec's first `servers.url` (server variables match one path segment). Pass an empty string to disable prefixing |
| `validateXmlSchema` | `false` | Generate an XSD from the models and emit `@validateSchema` XML rules (modsecurity3 flavor only). Off by default due to current engine limitations; see the [engine behavior notes](https://github.com/cognitivegears/oashield/blob/main/docs/engine-behavior.md) |
| `xsdOutputFile` | `schema.xsd` | XSD output file name |
| `xsdRulePath` | same as `xsdOutputFile` | XSD path written inside the `@validateSchema` XML rule |

## Deny behavior and logging

Every generated rule uses the `block` action, so the actual disruptive behavior is
decided in one place: the `SecDefaultAction` emitted at the top of `mainconfig.conf`.
`denyAction`, `denyStatus`, and `denyRedirectUrl` control that line:

```bash
# Return 429 instead of 403
--additional-properties denyStatus=429

# Detection-only: log violations, let requests through
--additional-properties denyAction=pass

# Redirect blocked requests
--additional-properties denyAction=redirect,denyRedirectUrl=https://example.com/blocked,denyStatus=302
```

If your ModSecurity/Coraza deployment already configures the engine (rule engine mode,
body access, default action), generate only the rules with `includeEngineConfig=false`.
Your existing `SecDefaultAction` then decides what blocking means.

## Engine flavors

Most generated rules are identical across both engines. The flavor only changes how JSON
request bodies are validated.

| Flavor | JSON body validation |
|---|---|
| `modsecurity3` (default) | Per-field rules generated from the OpenAPI schema: required-property presence, per-property type patterns, numeric minimum/maximum, and an `ARGS_NAMES` allowlist that rejects undeclared properties |
| `coraza` | The same per-field rules **plus** a `@validateSchema` rule that validates the raw body against the generated JSON Schema. `@validateSchema` is Coraza-only; ModSecurity v3's operator of the same name is XSD/XML-only |

## Limitations of per-field body validation

These apply to the `modsecurity3` flavor's per-field checks. Coraza's `@validateSchema`
additionally covers all of them:

- **Type coercion:** values are validated after the engine flattens JSON to strings, so a
  JSON number where a free-form string is expected (e.g. `"name": 123`) is not
  distinguishable.
- **`required` scope:** enforced for object properties (nested ones only when their
  parent object is present, per JSON Schema semantics), but not per array element. An
  empty array satisfies a required array property only on the `coraza` flavor.
- **Nesting depth:** model nesting is flattened to 5 levels; deeper properties are
  covered only by the unknown-property allowlist.
- **Numeric bounds on path parameters:** `minimum`/`maximum` on *path* parameters is
  enforced only lexically, via the embedded path pattern.
- **`oneOf` / `anyOf` composition:** enforced as the *union* of the member schemas.
  Primitive unions are validated against an alternation of the member patterns; model
  unions validate and allowlist the properties of every branch, but `required` properties
  inside a branch are not enforced, and `oneOf`'s exactly-one semantics are not
  distinguished from `anyOf`. `allOf` models are validated fully (members are merged).
  The generated JSON Schema keeps the exact `oneOf`/`anyOf` keywords for Coraza's
  `@validateSchema`.
